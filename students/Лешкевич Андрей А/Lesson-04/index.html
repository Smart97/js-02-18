"Wayne, keep practising and one day you're gonna have so many trophies we're not going to have room for them all," his dad said.
Walter preached an old fashioned ethic -- hard work pays off.
After a bad game when he was 11, Wayne got a chewing out from his dad: "People are going to judge you on how you perform every night. Never forget that."
The NHL star recalls getting a similar earful when he was 21, during the 1983 Stanley Cup playoffs.
"I don't know where I'd be without him, but I know it wouldn't be in the NHL," Wayne said in his autobiography.
"I just think I told him to play good," said Walter.
At times, hockey got in the way. Walter recalled missing the 1972 birth of Brent, their youngest, because Wayne was playing at a big minor tournament south of the border.
"Phyllis remembers that when I walked into her room in the maternity ward, the first thing I said to her was 'We won, we won!"' he wrote. "She looked at me like I was crazy and said 'It's a boy, Walter.' I guess I have to admit that sometimes I took my devotion as a hockey dad a little too far!
"But of course, I welcomed my brand new son with open arms -- another budding hockey player, after all."`;
